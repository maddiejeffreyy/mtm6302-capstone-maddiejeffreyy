To code this asssignment, Istarted with coding the background colours of the webpage. I then coded and styled the first pokedex card. Once I was content with the first card I copy and pasted the card code to create all the other cards and just changed the names and pictures. Then I organized the cards into a grid for mobile, tablet, and desktop screens. I then worked on the header, footer, view more button, and all/caught button. I found these to be the most difficult parts of the assignment. I had a hard time getting the spacing right in the navbar of the tablet and desktop versions. I also had a difficult time getting the hover state of the all/caught button to matvh the shape of the button, it's still not perfect. My only other frustration is how the pictures fit the cards. Since they are all different sizes I had a tough time getting them to fill the cards evenly and if I could achieve that then some of the picture would be cut off. If I coded it so the viewer could see the whole picture wihtout any parts cut off then the cards would become different heights and caught/catch button isn't in the same spot on each. I tried to code it perfectly but couldn't figure it out so I tried to find a happy medium between these two issues.
