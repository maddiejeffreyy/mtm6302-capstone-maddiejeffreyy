I really didn't get that far in this assignment. I felt very lost/overwhelmed and didn't know where to start. I felt very confused and felt my javascript knowledge is much more basic than what this assignment required. I already struggled alot to get what I have on my website done through Javascript that I decided I'd just call it quits after that since I don't have all the time in the world to figure this out. I thought my time would be better spent doing my other assignments and tending to other responsabilities in my life especially since I don't plan on going the developer route after graduation.
